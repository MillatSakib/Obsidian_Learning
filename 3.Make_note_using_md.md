In Obsidian we take notes using Markdown. So for taking note using Obsidian we have to learn about Markdown at first. So we learn how can I formatting using Markdown.


## How Markdown are Works:
---
When you write Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an `.md` or `.markdown` extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?

The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. Through Markdown processing software the markdown are converted into HTML. Then we show the output of html. The processing flowchart are given bellow:

![[markdown_process.png]]


## Basic Syntax of Markdown:
---
### Heading:
---
For create a heading, add number sign (#) and then add a space. The number of # sign are define the Heading number. There has six heading in Markdown like as HTML.
```md

# This is Heading 1
## This is Heading 2
### This is Heading 3
#### This is Heading 4
##### This is Heading 5
###### This is Heading 6
```



### Horizontal Line:
---
Here you can see there has a vertical line. If we want to add a vertical line after heading or anywhere then we have to use the sign `---` or `___` or `***`

### Paragraph:
---
For make a paragraph you have to add a new line in your note. You don't add any symbol to make paragraph. An example are given bellow:

```
I am happy 

Because I have Healthy, Alhamdulillah.
```


### Line Break:
---
For add line break we don't use any symbols . We just go to the next line to make a line break. This is very simple. An example are given bellow:
```
This is first line.
Ths is second line.
```

### Emphasis:
---
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

#### Bold:
---
For make a bold text you can use two approach. But the most trending approach are add `**` sign before and after the text. All approach are show in the Example are given bellow:
```
I love **Bangladesh.**
I love __Bangladesh.__
```


#### Italic:
---
For add italic effect to your text we can use two approach like bold. But the most trending approach are use `*` sign before and after the text. All approach are show in the Example are given bellow:
```
I love *Finland.*
I love _Finland._
```


#### Bold & Italic:
---
For formatting bold & italic at a time you have to use these two sign combine. I give a example bellow.


```
I hate ***India***
```


### Strikethrough:
---
Strikethrough means putting a horizontal line through the center of words.This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are an error not to be included in the document. For the word strikethrough, use two tilde marks (`~~`) before and after the word.

###### Code:
```md
The world is ~~flat~~ round.
```
###### Output:
The world is ~~flat~~ round.

### Blockquotes:
---
For add a Blockquotes in your Markdown notes you have to use `>` sign before your Blockquotes. If your Blockquotes has multiple line then at first of each line you have to add `>` sign. Two example are given bellow:

##### For single line:
```md
> This is a Blockquotes.
```

##### For multiple line
```md
> This is multiple 
> 
>  line Blockquotes.
```

#### Nested Blockquotes:
---
For make a Nested Blockquotes you have to add `>>` sign where the nested blockquotes are started. An Example are given bellow:

```md
> This the first paragraph.
>
>> And this is the nested paragraph.
```

#### Blockquotes with other Elements:
---
If you want to add different formatting of Elements in your Blockquotes you can add blockquotes at first of the line then you format or add element as you wish using markdown sign. I give an example bellow:

```md
> ##### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything* is going **well**.
```


### List:
---
There are three type of list in Markdown. They are 
- Ordered List.
- Unordered List.
- Nested List items.

##### Ordered List:
---

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The
numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number
one. I give three example bellow. Though I don't give the number in two list but they show output perfectly.

###### Code:
```md
1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.
4. Fourth item.
```
###### Output:
1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.
4. Fourth item.
###### Code:

```
1. First item.
1. Second item.
1. Third item.
1. Fourth item.
```
###### Output:
1. First item.
1. Second item.
1. Third item.
1. Fourth item.
###### Code:
```
1. First item.
8. Second item.
3. Third item.
10. Fourth item.
```
###### Output:
1. First item.
8. Second item.
3. Third item.
10. Fourth item.

### Unordered Lists:
---
To create an unordered list, add dashes `-` asterisks `*`, or plus signs  `+` in front of
line items.I give three example using these three sign bellow:

###### Code:
```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

Output: 
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
######  Code:

```md
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item
```

###### Output:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item


###### Code:
```md
+ First item
* Second item
- Third item
+ Fourth item
```
###### Output: 
+ First item
* Second item
- Third item
+ Fourth item

But for unordered list will use the dash (`-`)sign. Because this is the best practice.

#### Nested List Items:
---
There has two type of Nested List items. They are:-
- Ordered Nested List Items.
- Unordered Nested List Items.
- Hybrid Nested List Items.

##### Ordered Nested List Items:
---
If an ordered list remain under an ordered list then it called **Ordered Nested List Items.** We have to differentiate the nested list items using tab. An Example are given bellow for better understanding:-
###### Code:
```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
	1. Indented item
	2. Indented item
	3. Fourth item
```
###### Output:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
	1. Indented item
	2. Indented item
	3. Fourth item

##### Unordered Nested List Items:
---
Like ordered nested list items If an unordered list remain under an unordered list then it called **Unordered Nested List Items.**  
###### Code:
```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
	- Indented item
	- Indented item
	- Fourth item
```
###### Output:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
	- Indented item
	- Indented item
	- Fourth item

##### Hybrid Nested List Items:
---
If in a nested list there has a mixer of ordered list and unordered list then it will be called **Hybrid Nested List items.** An Example are given bellow:

###### Code:
```md
- First unordered item
- Second unordered item
- Third unordered item
	1. Indented ordered item
	2. Indented ordered item
	3. Fourth ordered item
```

###### Output:
- First unordered item
- Second unordered item
- Third unordered item
	1. Indented ordered item
	2. Indented ordered item
	3. Fourth ordered item




## Code:
---
If you want to add a line of code of a key word of code then you have to use  `` ` ``  sign before and after the word. An example are given bellow:
###### Code:
```md
In C you have to use `main` function
```

###### Output:
In C you have to use `main` function.


#### Code Blocks:
---

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they are in a list indent them eight space or two tabs.


###### Code:
```html
	<html>
		<head>
			<title> This is Title </title>
			</head>
			<body>
			This is body
			</body>
			</head>
		</html>
```

###### Output:

		<html>
		<head>
			<title> This is Title </title>
			</head>
			<body>
			This is body
			</body>
			</head>
		</html>

### Code:
---
If you you want to write  code without language highlight then you have to add    ` ``` `  sign before and after the code. An example are given bellow for better understanding:-
###### Code:
<pre>``` 
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
int main(){
printf("Hello world");
}
``` </pre>
###### Output:
``` 
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
int main(){
printf("Hello world");
}
``` 

Now if you want the code will be highlighted by it's syntax then you have to add first ` ```file_extention ` and add at last of your code ` ``` ` , then the code will be highlighted.

An example are given bellow:
###### Code: 
``` 
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
int main(){
printf("Hello world");
}
``` 

###### Output:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
printf("Hello world");
}
```


## Images:
---
If you want to add a image in your note then you have to follow the structure bellow:
```md
![title](paste_your_link_here)
```

You can also add also add resolution using the on the image.But if you do it you can't add title. The structure of  adding height and width are given bellow:
```md
![[another_vault.png|200x200]]
```


## Link:

If you want to add link you have to follow the structure given bellow:

```md
[Url info here](paste_your link here)

[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)
```

###### Link a Email:
To add a link to mail you have to follow the structure bellow:
```md
<fake@example.com>
```


## Tables:
---
To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and
use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of
the table.
```md
| Syntax    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------|
| Header      | Title     |
| Paragraph   | Text      |


```

Cell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.
```md
| Syntax | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
```

Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be tedious. To speed up the
process, try using the [Markdown Tables Generator.](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) Build a table using the
graphical interface, and then copy the generated Markdown-formatted text
into your file.

### Task Lists:
---
Task list are allow you to create a list of items with checkbox. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkbox will displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).
###### Code:

```md
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
```
###### Output: 
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
